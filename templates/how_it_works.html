            <!-- Best Practices -->

                <h2>Best Practices</h2>

                <h3>Writing Good Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> "What time should we meet on Friday?" is better than "When should
                        we meet?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay neutral:</strong> Avoid leading questions that suggest a preferred answer</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> One question per poll works best</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Creating Effective Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cover all choices:</strong> Make sure all reasonable options are included</li>
                    <li><strong>Be mutually exclusive:</strong> Options shouldn't overlap</li>
                    <li><strong>Use parallel structure:</strong> Keep options similar in format</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider "Other":</strong> For open-ended questions, consider adding an "Other" option
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Maximizing Response Rates</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Share at the right time:</strong> Consider when your audience is most active</li>
                    <li><strong>Provide context:</strong> Tell people why their vote matters</li>
                    <li><strong>Set appropriate deadlines:</strong> Give people enough time to respond</li>
                    <li><strong>Send reminders:</strong> A gentle reminder can boost participation</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="content-section faq-section">
                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I edit my poll after creating it?</h3>
                    <p>For integrity reasons, polls cannot be edited after votes have been cast. We recommend previewing
                        your poll carefully before sharing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I delete my poll?</h3>
                    <p>If you created the poll on this device/browser, you'll see a "Delete Poll" button. This uses a
                        creator token stored in your browser session.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can someone vote multiple times?</h3>
                    <p>We use browser sessions to prevent duplicate votes. However, someone using a different browser or
                        device could vote again. For high-stakes polls, consider other verification methods.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are votes really anonymous?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! We don't collect IP addresses, email addresses, or any identifying information. We only
                        store a hashed token to prevent duplicate votes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What happens when a poll expires?</h3>
                    <p>Expired polls stop accepting new votes but remain viewable. They are automatically deleted from
                        our servers after a short period.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is there a limit to how many polls I can create?</h3>
                    <p>To prevent abuse, we limit poll creation to 10 polls per hour per session. This should be plenty
                        for normal use.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I see who voted for what?</h3>
                    <p>No. Polls are completely anonymous. Even as the poll creator, you can only see aggregate vote
                        counts, not individual votes.</p>
